### Technologies
- `Pug`: HTML templating for faster development
- `Scss`: CSS superset allowing nesting, variables, helper functions, and more
- `TypeScript`: JavaScript with type-checking to ensure code safety and prevent issues before runtime
- `express`: Node.js library for serving the page as well as API endpoints

### Directory Structure

- `/src`: The developer-written web page before compilation
- `app.js`: The express server providing static hosting and API endpoints
